# MusicDownloader
This script can be used to download youtube videos or playlists using youtube-dl as mp3 audio files.
Sometimes it may give a HTTP Error 403, To fix that you need to run youtube-dl --rm-cache-dir command in the terminal
This will only work by default on MacOS.
If you need to use it on other OS, you would need to change the PATH Variable which is used to tell youtube-dl where the downloaded files must be stored.
