# MusicDownloader
This script can be used to download youtube videos or playlists using youtube-dl as audio files.
it will download in .wav format although that can be changed.
This will only work by default on MacOS.
If you need to use it on other OS, you would need to change the PATH Variable which is used to tell youtube-dl where the downloaded files must be stored.
